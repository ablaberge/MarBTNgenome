# Scripts for steamer insertion calling/analysis, bias identification, TE library generation/analysis

* Identify steamer insertions in reference genome (need to treat this differently than rest, which have target site duplications)
* Steamer insertion site calling pipeline and downstream analysis of shared insertion sites
* Identification of bias to insert near ATG sequences
* Identification of bias to insert upstream genes
* Create TE library by merging REPdenovo and repeatmodeler outputs
* Estimate copy number of each TE in each sample
