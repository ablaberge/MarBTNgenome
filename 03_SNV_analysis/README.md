# Scripts for SNV analysis, including sample binning, phylogeny building, signature extraction, age estimation and dnds

*Contains the bulk of the analysis from the paper*

* Create phylogeny off pairwise differences in SNVs between samples
* Count SNVs in major bins (all cancer, just sublineages, etc.)
* De novo signature extraction
* Call stretches of loss of heterozygousity to exclude from somatic mutations
* Date cancer from signature S mutation rate
* dN/dS analysis
