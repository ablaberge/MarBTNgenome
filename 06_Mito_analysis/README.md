# Scripts for mitochondrial evolutionary analysis

* Map reads and call SNVs in mitochondrial genome
* Secondary screen for host contamination: how much host vs cancer mitochondria are in samples
* Calculate coverage across genome and estimate dloop copy number
* Create mitochondiral SNV-based phylogeny from differences between samples
* Mutational bias identification - C>T
* dN/dS
